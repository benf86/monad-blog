The idea for recursion schemes is pretty simple. We abstract over the
common parts of recursion and only specify what we do to each element.
Let's start with a simple example that uses the recursion-schemes
Haskell library.

How can we 

The plan for writing:
- what are recursion schemes
- what is an algebra?
- fixpoints of functors
- using recursion schemes in Haskell
- cata fusion
- similarity to the Free Monad
